# Task 05 – Keefer Law Firm Website

## Overview

For this task, I recreated the Keefer Law Firm website design. The goal was to make it look **exactly like the reference image**, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy. I used a specific color palette (Dark Red and Gray) and applied texture backgrounds to the menu, buttons, and footer.

I implemented this project in two different ways to practice my skills:
1.  **Tailwind CSS**: Using framework utilities for a fast, responsive build.
2.  **Pure HTML & CSS**: Writing custom CSS from scratch without any libraries.

Both versions look identical and are free of any code comments.

## How to View the Project

You can check out either version by opening the HTML files in your browser:

*   **Tailwind Version**: Go to `src/Tailwind/` and open `index.html`.
*   **Pure CSS Version**: Go to `src/HTML-CSS/` and open `index.html`.

*Note: Please keep the `Images` folder in place so the textures and icons load correctly.*

## What I Built

### Design Details
*   **Typography**: I used serif fonts (like Georgia) for the headings to match the "official legal" look of the design.
*   **Two-Tone Headings**: Headlines like "PRACTICE **AREAS**" use two different colors (Gray and Red) just like the design.
*   **Textures**: Instead of plain colors, I used the provided background images for the navigation bar, red buttons, and footer area.

### Asset Usage
I closely analyzed the `Images` folder and used:
*   The **shadow images** (`hr_shadow`, `lf_bt_hr_shadow`) to separate content sections.
*   The **red bullets** (`bullet_red.gif`) for lists.
*   The **mobile menu icon** which appears when you view the page on a smaller screen.
*   All the proper badges and logos (Avvo, National College).

### Responsiveness
The site is mobile-friendly. On smaller screens:
*   The top menu transforms into a simple menu icon.
*   The layout stacks in a single column so it's easy to read.
*   The "Call Our Offices" banner adjusts to fit the screen.

## Tech Stack

*   **HTML5**: Used for the structure of the page.
*   **CSS3**: Used for strict styling in the `src/HTML-CSS` version.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Used via CDN in the `src/Tailwind` version.
